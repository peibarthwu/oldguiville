       We thought that there were bounds to the city but discovered that we could expand infinitely (infinity by all practical uses).
       We can make more pages that we know what to do with, and expand our GUI into more space that we can possibly use.

   <p>
       For our purposes, we now know that we have no limited resources in Guiville. But we don't know what to do with this knowledge. Yet.
       If the wrong person got ahold of this knowlege they could move our house away into the infinite GUI.

       But we trust you. Who are you? How are you seeing this? Do you live in a different Gui-city that we have never heard of?
